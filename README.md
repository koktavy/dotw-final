# Drawing on the Web
# Final Project Platform

## Concepts:

1) A cubemap of a pleasant mountain top view. (Images here) When users move too far they “bump into” and “knock over” the walls and reveal something more akin to a movie set surrounding the area. The walls cannot be restored once the reality is known.

2) A critique of media bombardment in the modern world. Bright, flickering content is displayed on a grid of screens (think Chrome’s new-tab page, but likely square for sake of simplicity and far more in-your-face) which track the mouse location (and phone gyro, if possible) to tilt in that direction. Ideas for screen content: various ads, gifs, glitches, and links to content. When clicked on, content randomly changes with a disposition to eventually go dark. (Each with audio if appropriate/not too overwhelming?)

3) A flat image(s) that degrades over time. Perhaps into something more abstract and pleasing, or into a noisier somber image, a shell of itself. Contrasting the natural and the digital. Clicking restores pixels, promoting interaction. This is senseless interaction… Which, if we’re being honest, is most of the web. What layers can be added to make more sensory, and does that help the experience make any more sense?

4) Navigation: “Postcard” style window links that are ‘picked up’ on click, loading that page once the user clicks again on that window, floating down with semi-random variation if the user clicks elsewhere. This decentralizes the experience, eliminating traditional ordered organizations on the web while promoting more organic interaction. (Perhaps casting a shadow? Possible port to VR later?)
